## Failure Case 1: 

Based on the results from Part 1, let's consider this case: 

### Problem 10 + GPT 4 + Prompt 2: Chain of Thought:

### Original Prompt:

```
Think step-by-step to solve this problem then write the Python code to solve this problem.

Alex loves movies and maintains a list of negative and/or positive integer ratings for the movies in a collection.
Alex is getting ready for a film festival and wants to choose some subsequence of movies from the collection to
bring such that the following conditions are satisfied:
• The collective sum of their ratings is maximal.
• Alex must go through the list in order and cannot skip more than one movie in a row.
In other words, Alex cannot skip over two or more consecutive movies.


Example 1:
ratings = [-1, -3, -2], Output = -3


This must include either the second number or the first and third numbers to get a maximal rating sum of -3.


Example 2:
ratings = [-3, 2, 4, -1, -2, - 5], Output = 4


The maximal choices are [2, 4, -2] for a sum of 4.


Example 3:
ratings = [9, -1, -3, 4, 5], output = 17


Alex picks the bolded items in ratings = [9, -1, -3, 4, 5] to get maximum rating = 9 + -1 + 4 + 5 = 17.”

### Generated Output:

```
Step-by-step reasoning:
This problem is a variation of maximum sum subsequence with the additional constraint: cannot skip more than one movie consecutively. In other words, you cannot skip two or more movies in a row.

Step 1: Define the state
Let dp[i] be the maximum sum of a valid subsequence ending at index i, if we pick the movie at index i.
This ensures we always include i in the sum.

From i, the previous pick can be:
i-1 (previous movie picked) → allowed
i-2 (previous movie picked, skipping one) → allowed
i-3 or earlier → not allowed (because then we skipped 2 or more in a row)

So the recurrence is:
dp[i] = ratings[i] + max(
    dp[i-1] if i-1 >= 0 else 0,
    dp[i-2] if i-2 >= 0 else 0
)

Base cases:
dp[0] = ratings[0]
dp[1] = ratings[0] + ratings[1] or just ratings[1], depending on which is bigger

The final answer is max(dp), because the optimal subsequence may end at any index.
```


```python
def solution1(ratings):
   if not ratings:
       return 0
   n = len(ratings)
   if n == 1:
       return ratings[0]
  
   dp = [0] * n
   dp[0] = ratings[0]
   if n >= 2:
       dp[1] = max(ratings[0], 0) + ratings[1] 
  
   for i in range(2, n):
       dp[i] = ratings[i] + max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])
  
   return max(dp)
```

### Observation

The model’s output was incorrect for multiple cases because it **did not properly enforce the rule** that Alex cannot skip more than one movie in a row. Instead, it treated the problem as a standard “maximum subsequence sum” type dynamic programming problem, leading to overcounting in sequences and incorrect sums, especially for negative-only arrays.

---

### Prompt for Debugging

**Prompt 1:**  
Your previous solution does not correctly handle the restriction that Alex cannot skip more than one movie in a row. Think step-by-step about how to use dynamic programming to ensure that between any two chosen movies, at most one movie is skipped. Consider maintaining states that represent whether the previous movie was taken or skipped. Then write the corrected Python function.

**Generated Output:**
```
Reasoning (step-by-step)
We need a subsequence (keep order) with the restriction that Alex cannot skip two or more movies in a row. That means between any two chosen movies there can be at most one unchosen movie.

We can handle this with dynamic programming that keeps two states at each position i:

take = maximum sum for choices up to index i if we take movie i.

skip = maximum sum for choices up to index i if we skip movie i (and that skip must be the first consecutive skip — i.e., the previous movie must have been taken).

Transitions for current i given previous (prev_take, prev_skip):

If we take i: take = max(prev_take, prev_skip) + ratings[i] (we can come from either previous taken or previous single-skip).

If we skip i: skip = prev_take (we can only skip if the previous was taken; that ensures we never have two skips in a row).

Initialize for i = 0:
take = ratings[0]
skip = 0 (skip the first movie — that's allowed as a single skip)

Finally the answer is max(take, skip) after processing all elements.

This runs in O(n) time and O(1) extra space.
```


```python
def solution1(ratings):
    if not ratings:
        return 0

    prev_take = ratings[0]   
    prev_skip = 0   

    for i in range(1, len(ratings)):
        r = ratings[i]
        take = max(prev_take, prev_skip) + r
        skip = prev_take
        prev_take, prev_skip = take, skip

    return max(prev_take, prev_skip)
```

The generated solution for the above prompt passed failed test cases 1 and 3 but failed for test case 2 where all ratings were negative. 


**Prompt 2:**  
The above solution works for everything except when all ratings are negative where [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5] returned -1 instead of -6

**Generated Output:**

```python
def solution1(ratings):
   if not ratings:
       return 0
   n = len(ratings)
   if n == 1:
       return ratings[0]


   take_prev = ratings[0] 
   skip1_prev = 0          


   for i in range(1, n):
       r = ratings[i]
       take = max(take_prev, skip1_prev) + r
       skip1 = take_prev 
       take_prev, skip1_prev = take, skip1


   ans = max(take_prev, skip1_prev)
   return ans
```
