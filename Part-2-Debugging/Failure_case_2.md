## Failure Case 2: 

Based on the results from Part 1, let's consider this case: 

### Problem 7 + Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Prompt 2: Self Planning: 

---
### Original Prompt:

```
Before writing code, outline a plan that describes what functions you will implement and how they will interact. Then, based on your plan, write a python code for this problem. Write a python function to find the last digit when the factorial of a divides factorial of b.
```

### Generated Output:

```
Plan
I'll create a solution to find the last digit when factorial of a divides factorial of b.
Understanding the Problem
When we divide b! by a!, we get:

b! / a! = b × (b-1) × (b-2) × ... × (a+1) (assuming b ≥ a)
We need to find the last digit of this result

Functions to Implement

last_digit_of_product(a, b) - Main function

Validates inputs (a and b should be non-negative, a ≤ b)
Computes the product b × (b-1) × ... × (a+1) while tracking only the last digit
Returns the last digit

Optimization approach:

We only need the last digit, so we can use modulo 10 arithmetic
Multiply numbers from (a+1) to b, keeping only last digit at each step
This avoids computing huge factorial values

Edge Cases to Handle

If a = b, the result is 1 (last digit = 1)
If a > b, this is invalid (factorial division would be < 1)
If a = 0, we're computing b! (full factorial)

Implementation Strategy

Use iterative multiplication with mod 10 to track only the last digit
This is efficient even for large values of b
```

```python
def solution3(a, b):
   if a > b:
       return 0
   if a == b:
       return 1
  
   result = 1
   for i in range(a + 1, b + 1):
       result = (result * i) % 10
  
   return result
```

### Observation: 

The function returns 0 for almost all cases where a > b. However, according to the test cases, this should yield a remainder of 1.

### Prompt for Debugging

Your previous solution did not correctly handle cases where the difference between B and A is large or when A equals B. Think step-by-step about how the last digit behaves when factorial(A) divides factorial(B). Consider that multiplying five consecutive integers always results in a trailing zero. Also, if a > b the output should be 1 not 0. 

Use these insights to simplify your code logic and improve efficiency. Then write the optimized Python function.

### Generated Output:
```
You're absolutely right! Let me think through this step-by-step.

Detailed Analysis
Key Insight: Five Consecutive Integers Always Give a Trailing Zero
When we multiply 5 consecutive integers, we're guaranteed to have:

At least one multiple of 5
At least two multiples of 2 (actually more)

This means we'll have at least one factor of 10, giving us a trailing zero.
Step-by-Step Logic
For b! / a! = product of integers from (a+1) to b:

If a = b: The product is empty (or 1), last digit = 1
If (b - a) ≥ 5: We're multiplying at least 5 consecutive integers

This ALWAYS contains a factor of 10
Last digit = 0


If (b - a) < 5: We multiply fewer than 5 consecutive integers

Need to actually compute the product modulo 10
Only cases: 1, 2, 3, or 4 consecutive integers

Why This Works
Examples:

6!/5! = 6 (only 1 number) → last digit = 6
7!/5! = 7×6 = 42 (2 numbers) → last digit = 2
8!/5! = 8×7×6 = 336 (3 numbers) → last digit = 6
9!/5! = 9×8×7×6 = 3024 (4 numbers) → last digit = 4
10!/5! = 10×9×8×7×6 = 30240 (5 numbers) → last digit = 0
11!/5! = 11×10×9×8×7×6 (6 numbers, includes 5 consecutive) → last digit = 0
```

```python 
def solution4(a, b):
    difference = b - a
    if difference >= 5:
        return 0
    if difference == 0:
        return 1
    
    last_digit = 1
    for num in range(a + 1, b + 1):
        last_digit = (last_digit * num) % 10
    
    return last_digit

```
