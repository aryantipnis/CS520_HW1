Output: 
Step-by-step reasoning
A polynomial is given by coefficients xs meaning xs[0] + xs[1]*x + xs[2]*x^2 + ....
The derivative of a*x^k is k*a*x^(k-1). Thus the coefficient for x^(k-1) in the derivative is k * xs[k].
For input list xs of length n, the derivative will have length n-1 (a constant or empty polynomial gives no coefficients).
So compute [1*xs[1], 2*xs[2], 3*xs[3], ..., (n-1)*xs[n-1]].
Return an empty list when n <= 1.

Output: 
🧠 Step 1: Problem Understanding
We are given a list of coefficients representing a polynomial:

We need to compute its derivative, and return the coefficients of the derivative polynomial in the same list form.
✅ Example:
If xs = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5],
then 

So the result should be [1, 4, 12, 20].
🧩 Step 2: Plan / Function Design
Function 1: derivative(xs)
Purpose:
Given a list of coefficients representing a polynomial, return the coefficients of its derivative.
Steps:
Check if the input list is empty or has one element:
If so, derivative is a constant (or zero), return [] (since constant derivative = 0).
Iterate over coefficients starting from index 1:
Each derivative coefficient = xs[i] * i
 
Collect results in a new list.
Return the resulting list of coefficients.

⚙️ Step 3: Function Interaction
There's only one function:
derivative(xs) → computes and returns a list.
No helper functions are needed because the logic is simple and self-contained.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Understand the problem:

Compare two lists of strings
Calculate the total number of characters in all strings for each list
Return the list with fewer total characters
If both lists have the same total, return the first list

Verify with examples:

[], []:

List 1 total: 0 chars
List 2 total: 0 chars
Same → return first list: [] ✓

['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']:

List 1: 'hi'(2) + 'admin'(5) = 7 chars
List 2: 'hI'(2) + 'Hi'(2) = 4 chars
4 < 7 → return list 2: ['hI', 'Hi'] ✓


['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']:

List 1: 2 + 5 = 7 chars
List 2: 2 + 2 + 5 + 7 = 16 chars
7 < 16 → return list 1: ['hi', 'admin'] ✓

['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']:

List 1: 2 + 5 = 7 chars
List 2: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 chars
6 < 7 → return list 2: ['hI', 'hi', 'hi'] ✓

['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']:

List 1: 1 char
List 2: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 chars
1 < 5 → return list 1: ['4'] ✓

Algorithm:

Calculate total characters in list 1
Calculate total characters in list 2
Compare and return the list with fewer characters
If equal, return list 1

Implementation approach:

Use sum() with len() to calculate total characters
Use conditional logic to return the appropriate list

Output: 
PlanI'll create a solution with the following approach:Functions to Implement:
derivative(xs) - Main function that:

Takes a list of coefficients representing a polynomial
Calculates the derivative using the power rule
Returns a new list of coefficients representing the derivative polynomial


Mathematical Background:The power rule for derivatives states:

If f(x) = a * x^n, then f'(x) = a * n * x^(n-1)
For a polynomial xs[0] + xs[1]*x + xs[2]*x^2 + xs[3]*x^3 + ...:

Derivative of constant term xs[0] is 0 (removed)
Derivative of xs[1]*x is xs[1] (power 1)
Derivative of xs[2]*x^2 is 2*xs[2]*x (coefficient becomes 2*xs[2])
Derivative of xs[3]*x^3 is 3*xs[3]*x^2 (coefficient becomes 3*xs[3])
General term: derivative of xs[i]*x^i is i*xs[i]*x^(i-1)
Algorithm Flow:
Handle edge cases:

If list is empty, return empty list
If list has only one element (constant), return empty list (derivative of constant is 0)



Iterate through coefficients starting from index 1 (skip constant term):

For each coefficient at index i, multiply it by i (the power)
Add the result to the derivative list



Return the list of derivative coefficients
Key Considerations:

Index represents the power of x
Multiply each coefficient by its index (power)
Start from index 1 (skip the constant term at index 0)
Result list will be one element shorter than input
Verification with Examples:

[3, 1, 2, 4, 5] represents 3 + 1*x + 2*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 5*x^4

Derivative: 1 + 4*x + 12*x^2 + 20*x^3 → [1, 4, 12, 20] ✓


[1, 2, 3] represents 1 + 2*x + 3*x^2

Derivative: 2 + 6*x → [2, 6] ✓
