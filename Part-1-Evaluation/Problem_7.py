Output: 
Step-by-step reasoning
For non-negative integers a and b, if a > b then a! does not divide b! â€” the quotient is not an integer. We'll treat that as an error (raise ValueError).
If a == b then b!/a! = 1, so the last digit is 1.
If a < b then b!/a! = (a+1)*(a+2)*...*b. We only need its last decimal digit (units digit), i.e. the product modulo 10.
Observations that allow quick answers:
If b - a >= 10, the consecutive integers (a+1,...,b) include at least one multiple of 10, so the product ends in 0. Thus the last digit is 0.
Otherwise, multiply the numbers (a+1) through b, reducing modulo 10 at every step. If the running result becomes 0 we can stop early. This is efficient because when b-a < 10 the loop is short.
Validate inputs: a and b must be integers and non-negative.

ðŸ§  Step 1: Problem Understanding
We need to find the last digit of the number when factorial of a divides factorial of b, 
b!/a! is not defined (factorial of a larger number can't divide smaller one),
but for this problem, we can assume to return 0.
So we can multiply these terms and find the last digit.

ðŸ§© Step 3: Plan / Design
We will implement one main function:
compute_Last_Digit(a: int, b: int) -> int
Steps:
Handle base cases:
If a == b: return 1
If a > b: return 0
Initialize a variable res = 1.
Loop from a + 1 to b (inclusive):
Multiply res by the current number.
Take only the last digit each time (res %= 10) to avoid overflow.
Return the final value of res.

Output: 
Plan
I'll create a solution with the following approach:
Understanding the Problem:
We need to find the last digit of the result when factorial(a) divides factorial(b), i.e., the last digit of b! / a!.
Mathematical simplification:

b! / a! = b x (b-1) x (b-2) x ... x (a+1) when b â‰¥ a
This is the product of all numbers from (a+1) to b

Functions to Implement:

last_digit_factorial_division(a, b) - Main function that:

Takes two integers a and b
Calculates the last digit of b! / a!
Returns the last digit (0-9)

Algorithm Flow:
Approach 1: Direct Calculation (for small values)

Handle edge cases:

If b < a: result is undefined or 0
If b == a: result is 1 (last digit = 1)
If a >= 10 or the range is large: result will end in 0 (many factors of 2 and 5)


Calculate b! / a! = product from (a+1) to b
Keep only the last digit at each step to avoid overflow
Return the last digit

Approach 2: Optimized (only tracking last digit)

Initialize result = 1
Multiply by each number from (a+1) to b
Keep only last digit (% 10) after each multiplication
Return the last digit

Key Considerations:

Only need to track the last digit, not the full result
If the range includes numbers â‰¥ 10, we'll have factors of 2 and 5, resulting in last digit 0
For small ranges, calculate iteratively while keeping only last digit
Edge cases: a >= b, a = 0, large numbers

Examples to verify:

b! / a! where a=3, b=5: 5!/3! = 120/6 = 20 â†’ last digit = 0
b! / a! where a=2, b=4: 4!/2! = 24/2 = 12 â†’ last digit = 2
b! / a! where a=5, b=7: 7!/5! = 5040/120 = 42 â†’ last digit = 2

Now, let me implement this:Last Digit of Factorial DivisionCode def last_digit_factorial_division(a, b):

    Find the last digit when factorial of a divides factorial of b.
    In other words, find the last digit of b! / a!
    
    Mathematical insight:
    b! / a! = b x (b-1) x (b-2) x ... x (a+1)
    
I've implemented a solution to find the last digit of factorial division with comprehensive testing:
Implementation Details:
Main Function (last_digit_factorial_division)
Key Algorithm:

Mathematical simplification: b! / a! = (a+1) x (a+2) x ... x b
Last digit tracking: Multiply numbers iteratively and keep only last digit using % 10
Optimizations:

If b < a: return 0 (invalid division)
If b == a: return 1 (factorial divides itself = 1)
If range â‰¥ 10 or contains both multiples of 2 and 5: return 0 (trailing zeros)

Algorithm Flow:
pythonlast_digit = 1
for num in range(a + 1, b + 1):
    last_digit = (last_digit * num) % 10
This keeps only the last digit at each step, preventing overflow and efficiently computing the result.
Examples:

a=3, b=5: 5!/3! = 5x4 = 20 â†’ last digit = 0
a=2, b=4: 4!/2! = 4x3 = 12 â†’ last digit = 2
a=5, b=7: 7!/5! = 7x6 = 42 â†’ last digit = 2
a=1, b=4: 4!/1! = 4x3x2 = 24 â†’ last digit = 4

Key Insights:

Trailing zeros: When the product includes both multiples of 2 and 5, the result ends in 0
Modulo arithmetic: We only need (result * num) % 10 at each step
No overflow: By keeping only last digit, we can handle arbitrarily large ranges
Verification: Included helper function to verify results with actual factorial calculations for small numbers

Time Complexity: O(b - a) - iterate through the range once
Space Complexity: O(1) - only tracking one integer
The solution handles all edge cases and includes detailed verification with actual factorial calculations!
