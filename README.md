# Overview

This repository is organized into **5 main parts** folders:  
**Part 1: Evaluation**, **Part 2: Debugging**,  **Part 3: Innovation**, **Problems**, **Prompts**.

---

## Folder: `Part-1-Evaluation/`

This section contains **10 Python problem files**:
### Each file includes:
- **4 solutions total**:
  - **2 LLMs Ã— 2 prompting strategies**
    - LLM 1 (e.g., GPT-5)
    - LLM 2 (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
    - Prompt 1: *Chain of Thought (CoT)*
    - Prompt 2: *Self Planning*
- **Correct solution from the dataset**
- **Comprehensive test cases** to evaluate correctness
- **Result comparison** between model outputs and the correct outputs

## Folder: `Part-2-Debugging/`
This section contains **2 Markdown files and 2 python files**:
### Each Markdown file includes: 
- A Failure Case with refined prompts for debugging and generated solutions

### Each Python file includes: 
- Generated revised solutions with test cases

## Folder: `Part-3-Innovation/`
This section contains: 
- **1 file that describes the strategy used**
- **4 mardown files that include the inputted prompts and LLM generated results**
- **4 python files that run the final code and test cases**

## Folder: `Problems`
A short description of the problem statement from the datasets, constraints and examples 

## Folder: `Prompts`
Contains original prompts used in Part 1 and new proposed strategy prompts for Part 3
