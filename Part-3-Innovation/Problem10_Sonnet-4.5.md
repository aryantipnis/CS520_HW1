## Problem 10 using Sonnet-4.5 model

Let's apply the new proposed strategy to this problem 

### Step 1: Planner: 

```
You are a planner. Problem: [Paste problem statement here].
1) Briefly (3–6 bullet points) outline the approach and the key constraint to maintain.*
2) List the 6 most important edge cases we must test.
```

1) Approach Outline

Dynamic Programming Strategy: Track two states at each position: the maximum sum if we take the current movie, and the maximum sum if we skip it.

Key Constraint: We cannot skip two or more consecutive movies. This means if we skip movie i, we must take movie i+1 (unless i is the last movie).

State Transitions:
If we take movie i: add its rating to the best result from taking or skipping movie i-1

If we skip movie i: we must have taken movie i-1, so use that value

Recurrence Relation: At each position, calculate the maximum sum achievable by either including or excluding the current movie, respecting the "no two consecutive skips" constraint.

Base Cases: Handle the first one or two movies explicitly, since the constraint behaves differently at the start.

2) Six Most Important Edge Cases

Single movie: ratings = [5] or ratings = [-10] — must return that movie's rating

Two movies: ratings = [3, -5] — can take just first, just second, or both; verify correct maximum

All negative ratings: ratings = [-5, -2, -8, -1] — must still select movies respecting the skip constraint, finding the least negative sum

Alternating positive/negative with forced bad choices: ratings = [10, -20, 10, -20, 10] — tests whether algorithm correctly handles when skipping forces taking a negative value

Optimal solution requires taking consecutive movies: ratings = [5, 10, -1] — best sum is 14 (take all three), not skipping any

Long sequence where constraint forces suboptimal local choices: ratings = [1, -10, -10, 100] — must take the two -10s to reach 100, testing that the algorithm doesn't prematurely skip
```

### Step 2: Tester:
```
You are a Tester. Using the plan and edge cases from Planner, produce 10 unit tests in Python: a list of (input, expected_output). Include comments saying why each test matters.
```

```python 
test_cases = [
    # Test 1: Single movie (positive)
    ([5], 5),
    # Why: Base case - with only one movie, must select it regardless of rating
    
    # Test 2: Single movie (negative)
    ([-10], -10),
    # Why: Base case - even with negative rating, must select the only available movie
    
    # Test 3: Two movies - both positive
    ([3, 7], 10),
    # Why: Tests that we take both when it's optimal (no skipping needed)
    
    # Test 4: Two movies - mixed signs
    ([10, -5], 10),
    # Why: Tests selection when second movie is negative; optimal is to skip it
    
    # Test 5: All negative ratings
    ([-5, -2, -8, -1], -3),
    # Why: Critical test - must find least negative sum while respecting skip constraint
    # Optimal: skip -5, take -2, skip -8, take -1 = -3
    
    # Test 6: Example 1 from problem
    ([-1, -3, -2], -3),
    # Why: Given example - validates basic algorithm correctness with negatives
    # Can take [-3] or [-1, -2] both give -3
    
    # Test 7: Example 2 from problem
    ([-3, 2, 4, -1, -2, -5], 4),
    # Why: Given example - tests longer sequence with mixed signs
    # Optimal: [2, 4, -2] = 4
    
    # Test 8: Example 3 from problem
    ([9, -1, -3, 4, 5], 17),
    # Why: Given example - validates that taking consecutive movies can be optimal
    # Optimal: [9, -1, 4, 5] = 17
    
    # Test 9: Forced to take negative to reach high positive
    ([1, -10, -10, 100], 81),
    # Why: Tests constraint enforcement - cannot skip both -10s, must take at least one
    # Optimal: [1, -10, -10, 100] = 81 or skip first: [-10, -10, 100] = 80
    
    # Test 10: Alternating high/low values
    ([20, -15, 18, -12, 25], 63),
    # Optimal: take 20, skip -15 (forces take 18), skip -12 (forces take 25) = 63

        print()
    
    print(f"Results: {passed} passed, {failed} failed out of {len(test_cases)} tests")
```

### Step 4: Run Tests

After running the above code locally, I found that the above code failed for these 2 test cases when input = [-5, -2, -8, -1] and input = [-3, 2, 4, -1, -2, -5].

### Step 5: Refinement

```
The following tests failed when input = [-5, -2, -8, -1] expected was -3 we got -8 and input = [-3, 2, 4, -1, -2, -5] expected was 4 we got 1. Generate a code that takes into account this failing test case. Take into account that you cannot skip more than one element and for all negative values the result should be maximum
```

After running Step 5 runnning multiple times with more hints, I got the following solution. 

***Generated Code***: 

```python
def solution(ratings):
    n = len(ratings)
    
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    if n == 1:
        return ratings[0]
    
    take = [0] * n
    skip = [float('-inf')] * n
    
    take[0] = ratings[0] 
    skip[0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        take[i] = ratings[i] + max(take[i - 1], skip[i - 1])
        skip[i] = take[i - 1]
    
    return max(take[-1], skip[-1])
```

This passes all the failed test cases in previous steps.

### Step 6: Counterexample Search:

```
Run this code over random inputs to find a counterexample that fails the test.
```

There were no counter examples, thus we can assume that the code we have is correct.
