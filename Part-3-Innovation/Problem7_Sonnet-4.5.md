## Problem 7 using Sonnet-4.5 model

Let's apply the new proposed strategy to this problem 

### Step 1: Planner: 

```
You are a planner. Problem: [Paste problem statement here].
1) Briefly (3–6 bullet points) outline the approach and the key constraint to maintain.*
2) List the 6 most important edge cases we must test.

Approach Outline

Core insight: We need to find the last digit of b! / a!, which equals the last digit of a! × (a+1) × (a+2) × ... × b

Key constraint: When a > b, the division b! / a! is a fraction less than 1, but we must return 1 (not 0) as specified

Algorithm: Multiply numbers from (a+1) to b and track only the last digit at each step (mod 10) to avoid overflow
Optimization: Since we only care about the last digit, we can use modulo 10 arithmetic throughout

Base cases: Handle a == b (result is 1) and a > b (result is 1 per requirements) separately

6 Most Important Edge Cases: 

a > b: Must return 1, not 0 or error (e.g., a=5, b=3 → 1)

a == b: Factorial divided by itself is 1 (e.g., a=5, b=5 → 1)

a = 0, b = 0: Both factorials are 1, so result is 1

a = 0, b > 0: Division by 0! = 1, so just find last digit of b! (e.g., a=0, b=5 → 0)

Large values crossing last digit cycles: Products that pass through multiples of 10 (e.g., a=4, b=10 where we multiply 5×...×10, guaranteeing last digit 0)

Consecutive numbers with known patterns: Small ranges like a=1, b=5 where 5!/1! = 120 → last digit 0, useful for validation
```

### Step 2: Tester:
```
You are a Tester. Using the plan and edge cases from Planner, produce 10 unit tests in Python: a list of (input, expected_output). Include comments saying why each test matters.
```

***Generated Code:***

```python 
# Unit tests for last digit of factorial division problem
# Format: (a, b, expected_output)

test_cases = [
    # Test 1: Basic case where a > b (critical constraint)
    (5, 3, 1),
    # Why: Must return 1 when a > b, not 0 or error. This is the key requirement.
    
    # Test 2: Equal values
    (5, 5, 1),
    # Why: Any number divided by itself equals 1. Tests a == b edge case.
    
    # Test 3: Both zero
    (0, 0, 1),
    # Why: 0! / 0! = 1 / 1 = 1. Tests boundary at zero.
    
    # Test 4: a = 0, small b
    (0, 5, 0),
    # Why: 5! = 120, last digit is 0. Tests division by 1 (since 0! = 1).
    
    # Test 5: Small range multiplication
    (1, 5, 0),
    # Why: 5!/1! = 120, last digit 0. Verifies simple calculation.
    
    # Test 6: Range that includes 5 and even number (guarantees 0)
    (4, 10, 0),
    # Why: Product includes 5×6×...×10, which contains 5 and multiple of 2, giving last digit 0.
    
    # Test 7: Small range avoiding multiples of 5
    (5, 8, 6),
    # Why: 6×7×8 = 336, last digit 6. Tests multiplication without hitting 0.
    
    # Test 8: Single increment
    (3, 4, 4),
    # Why: 4!/3! = 4. Tests minimal range where b = a + 1.
    
    # Test 9: Large a > b difference
    (100, 50, 1),
    # Why: Ensures a > b constraint holds even with large numbers.
    
    # Test 10: Range with cycling last digits
    (10, 13, 6),
    # Why: 11×12×13 = 1716, last digit 6. Tests pattern after passing through 10.
]

# Print tests in readable format
for i, (a, b, expected) in enumerate(test_cases, 1):
    print(f"Test {i}: a={a}, b={b} → expected={expected}")
```

### Step 3: Coder:
```
You are a Coder. Implement the function `solution(args...)` described below. Use the plan and tests from Planner/Tester. Write clean, well-commented Python code and include the tests as a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to run them.
Problem: [Paste problem statement here with test cases]
Return only the code file.
```

***Generated Code:***
```python 
def solution(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    if a > b:
        return 1
    if a == b:
        return 1
    
    last_digit = 1
    for num in range(a + 1, b + 1):
        last_digit = (last_digit * num) % 10
        if last_digit == 0:
            break
    
    return last_digit

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_cases = [
    (5, 3, 1),
    (5, 5, 1),
    (0, 0, 1),
    (0, 5, 0),
    (1, 5, 0),
    (4, 10, 0),
    (5, 8, 6),
    (3, 4, 4),
    (100, 50, 1),
    (10, 13, 6),
   ]
    
    print("Running tests...\n")
    all_passed = True
    
    for i, (a, b, expected) in enumerate(test_cases, 1):
        result = solution(a, b)
        status = "✓ PASS" if result == expected else "✗ FAIL"
        
        if result != expected:
            all_passed = False
            
        print(f"Test {i}: a={a}, b={b}")
        print(f"  Expected: {expected}, Got: {result} {status}\n")
    
    if all_passed:
        print("=" * 50)
        print("All tests passed! ✓")
        print("=" * 50)
    else:
        print("=" * 50)
        print("Some tests failed! ✗")
        print("=" * 50)
```
### Step 4: Run Tests

After running the above code locally, I found that the code passed for all the test cases but did not take into account the condition when (b - a) >= 5. 

### Step 5: Refinement: 

```
The above code passes all the test cases but consider a case where there are five consecutive numbers. What will the last digit be then? Add this case to the code. 
```

***Generated Code:***
```python
def solution(a, b):
    if b == a:
        return 1

    if (b - a) >= 5: 
        return 0
    
    last_digit = 1
    for num in range(a + 1, b + 1):
        last_digit = (last_digit * num) % 10
    
    return last_digit
```

### Step 6: Counterexample Search:

```
Run this code over random inputs to find a counterexample that fails the test.
```

There were no counter examples, thus we can assume that the code we have is correct.
