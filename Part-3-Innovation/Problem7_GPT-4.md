## Problem 7 using GPT-4 model

Let's apply the new proposed strategy to this problem 

### Step 1: Planner: 

```
You are a planner. Problem: [Paste problem statement here].
1) Briefly (3–6 bullet points) outline the approach and the key constraint to maintain.*
2) List the 6 most important edge cases we must test.
```

```
1️⃣ Approach Outline

Understand the math: We need the last digit of (b! / a!), i.e., the product of all integers from (a+1) to b, modulo 10.

Handle direction:
If a == b, result is 1 (since factorials are equal).
If a > b, result is also 1 (as per problem statement).

Simplify computation:
If (b - a) >= 5, result is 0 because the product includes multiples of 10 (since both 2 and 5 are present).

Otherwise, directly compute (a+1) * (a+2) * … * b, taking the modulo 10 at each step to avoid overflow.

Key constraint: Maintain mod 10 at every multiplication to prevent large number growth and focus only on the last digit.

2️⃣ Critical Edge Cases
a = b = 0 → factorial(0)/factorial(0) = 1 → expected 1
a = b = 5 → expected 1
a > b (e.g., a=7, b=3) → expected 1
b - a ≥ 5 (e.g., a=1, b=6) → includes multiples of 10 → expected 0

Small range (no multiple of 10) (e.g., a=3, b=5 → (4×5)=20 → last digit 0)

Negative or minimal case (e.g., a=0, b=1 → (1)=1 → last digit 1)
```

### Step 2: Tester:
```
You are a Tester. Using the plan and edge cases from Planner, produce 10 unit tests in Python: a list of (input, expected_output). Include comments saying why each test matters.
```

***Generated Code:***

```python 
# Each test is of the form: ((a, b), expected_output)

tests = [
    # 1️⃣ Basic equality case — factorials are the same
    ((0, 0), 1),   # factorial(0)/factorial(0) = 1

    # 2️⃣ Another equality case (a = b)
    ((5, 5), 1),   # factorial(5)/factorial(5) = 1

    # 3️⃣ a > b case — special rule from problem statement
    ((7, 3), 1),   # When a > b, output must be 1

    # 4️⃣ Simple increasing range — no multiple of 10
    ((0, 3), 6),   # (1×2×3)=6 → last digit = 6

    # 5️⃣ Range includes a multiple of 10 (produces 0)
    ((3, 5), 0),   # (4×5)=20 → last digit = 0

    # 6️⃣ Large gap => guaranteed 0 (because includes 2 and 5)
    ((1, 6), 0),   # (2×3×4×5×6)=720 → last digit = 0

    # 7️⃣ Edge just before large gap rule
    ((2, 6), 2),   # (3×4×5×6)=360 → last digit = 0 actually (verify computation)
                   # Correction: (3×4×5×6)=360 → last digit 0
                   # So expected_output = 0
                   # (Keeping note for validation)

    # 8️⃣ Minimal non-trivial case
    ((0, 1), 1),   # factorial(1)/factorial(0)=1 → last digit = 1

    # 9️⃣ Small reverse inputs (still a > b)
    ((4, 2), 1),   # a > b → rule says result = 1

    # 🔟 Random mid-range test without full range of 2 and 5
    ((8, 9), 9),   # (9) → last digit = 9
]
```

### Step 3: Coder:
```
You are a Coder. Implement the function `solution(args...)` described below. Use the plan and tests from Planner/Tester. Write clean, well-commented Python code and include the tests as a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to run them.
Problem: [Paste problem statement here with test cases]
Return only the code file.
```

***Generated Code:***
```python 
def solution(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    if a >= b:
        return 1

    if (b - a) >= 5:
        return 0

    result = 1
    for i in range(a + 1, b + 1):
        result = (result * (i % 10)) % 10

    return result % 10

if __name__ == "__main__":
    tests = [
        ((0, 0), 1),   
        ((5, 5), 1),   
        ((7, 3), 1),
        ((0, 3), 6),  
        ((3, 5), 0),  
        ((1, 6), 0),  
        ((2, 6), 0), 
        ((0, 1), 1), 
        ((4, 2), 1), 
        ((8, 9), 9),   
    ]

    for (a, b), expected in tests:
        result = solution(a, b)
        print(f"solution({a}, {b}) = {result} | expected = {expected} | {'PASS' if result == expected else 'FAIL'}")
```
### Step 4: Run Tests

After running the above code locally, I found that the code passed for all the test cases and even took into account the condition 
when (b - a) >= 5 that prompts in Part 1 failed to. 


### Step 6: Counterexample Search:

```
Run this code over random inputs to find a counterexample that fails the test.
```

***Generated Code***: 

Code generated is given in Problem10_Sonnet-4.5.py. You can run this by running `python Problem10_Sonnet-4.5.py`

There were no counter examples, thus we can assume that the code we have is correct.
